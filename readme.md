# XSS Example

## Overview

One of my goals is to learn more about cross-site scriping. As part of this, I decided to make a couple of applications. One which is a vanilla JS app and the other is a nextjs application.

Both apps have been developed with vulnerabilities to see how easily an attacker could exploit the different types of apps. 

## Folders

### api 

This is the api that stores/retrieves the comments from the `vanilla` and the `nextjs` apps.

### docs

Just some example scripts and information on XSS.

### evil-api

This is the api the the attacker will use to store the stolen data.

### nextjs

The nextjs application.

### vanilla

The vanilla JS vulnerable application.

## Other

Both the `api` and `evil-api` use mongoDB to store data.
